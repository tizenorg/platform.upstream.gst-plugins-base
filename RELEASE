Release notes for GStreamer Base Plugins 1.0.0

The GStreamer project is pleased to announce the very first release of the
new API and ABI-stable 1.x series of the GStreamer multimedia framework.

The 1.x series is a stable series targeted at end users. It is not API or ABI
compatible with the 0.10.x series. It can, however, be installed in parallel
with the 0.10.x series and will not affect an existing 0.10.x installation.

Major improvements include: more flexible memory handling; extensible and
negotiable metadata for buffers; caps negotiation and renegotiation mechanisms,
decoupled from buffer allocation; improved caps renegotiation; automatic
re-sending of state for dynamic pipelines; reworked and more fine-grained pad
probing; simpler and more descriptive audio and video caps; more efficient
allocation of buffers, events and other mini objects; improved timestamp
handling; support for gobject-inspection-based language bindings; countless
other improvements.

Most of these changes involve the GStreamer plugin API. The application API
has changed comparatively little, and most applications should be fairly easy
to port to the new API. There is a porting guide available.

The GStreamer team would like to thank everyone who helped bring this release
about, whether by submitting patches, reporting bugs, testing, sponsoring
development, attending hackfests, or simply supplying moral support.

This is the end of a long development process, but also the beginning of
one. This release does not mark the pinnacle of perfection, but the point
where the team is content with the API and stability and quality of the code
base in general, especially compared to the old 0.10 series.

There will be bugs to fix, and starting from this release there will be
distinct bug-fixing and feature development cycles, with the goal of getting
bug-fixes out quicker and unencumbered by other more risky changes. See

for a tentative road map and possible schedule.
